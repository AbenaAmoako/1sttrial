    <h3>WHY CHOOSE ASPEN FLORA</h3>
    <p id="p1">Rose cultivation began in Lithuania around the 18th century. These roses are high quality and award winners in competitions around the world, prized for their beauty, colour or resistance. The most commonly cultivated are peonies - In Lithuania, these are the great peony, the medicinal peony, the bush peony, the European peony and their varieties. Peony is also known as “pinavija” in Lithuania. Back in the day, peonies were loved and respected for their fragrant early blossoms, which were also used for medicinal purposes. Peonies were one of the main remedies for “fright” in adults and children, especially when they were frightened of something and then cried at night, jumping out of bed. Yes, Roses were valued for their medicinal purposes. In the 16th century, white rose syrup became very popular. Rose flowers possess anti-depressant, anti-spasmodic,
        aphrodisiac, astringent, anti- bacterial and antiseptic qualities. Rose hips tea is also used in the treatment of diarrhoea.</p>
    <p id="p2">It is no suprise that the founder of Aspen Flora decided to go back to his roots and love for flowers. He holds a family tradition that was birthed 150 years ago. He started off as a peddlar in Birmingham to grow the brand. The brand has grown fond of putting smiles on the faces of clients on occasions and bringing spectacular colours to their events. Aspen Flora loves to harness the culture of roses. Even better, the perfumes that emanate from Rose flowers give off a soothing and irrestible effect. Hence, the reason for their niche. Who else to arrange and provide you with flowers than someone who literally loves and adores these plants from birth!</p>
